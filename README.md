# Logno's DOTFILES
I'm no Linux mastermind, but over the past year or so I've tailored my dotfiles pretty well to my liking, and I think they are actually semi-organized now.

### NeoVim

I won't list all the standard keymaps because I'm not a crazy person and you need to learn those on your own. Like right now, go. Do :Tutor a few times or something. Anyway, these are some of my custom keymaps.
